"""Finding path/context normalization and the changed-files filter, ported
from the Go implementation (internal/rwcheck/diff in runwhen-runner) per
docs/static-checks/CONTRACT.md.

Findings surface only as GitHub Check Runs, which are keyed by commit SHA:
every push regenerates the whole set and GitHub discards the previous one,
so there is no cross-run identity to reconcile against. This module used to
also compute a `fingerprint` for that purpose; it was removed once its only
consumer (an LLM-prompt citation token) stopped needing it.

# in one call, this result is the *only* durable record a static-check task

# there is no findings table, and whatever this cap drops is gone forever --

# papi's findings catalog. Do not lower this to make either of those nicer.

# half as headroom for JSON envelope overhead and per-finding size variance,
# against the ~330 bytes/finding measured on the field failure this exists to
# prevent (a run against the 468-platform monorepo: 19,527 raw ruff findings,
# ~6.3 MB, the "several MB" result papi 413'd three times before max_attempts
# failed the run -- back when the ingress was nginx's 1 MB default) gives
# 33,554,432 // 330 = 101,679, rounded down to a clean 100,000. That leaves
# generous headroom above any realistic PR-scoped result, and even lets a
