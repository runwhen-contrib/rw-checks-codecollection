"""`rwtask run <capability-dir> --request request.json [--credentials creds.json]
[--allow-anonymous]`

The reference implementation: the same code path as `rwtask serve`
(host.run_request), against the local filesystem, with credentials from a
local file. A capability author needs no cluster to develop against this SDK
-- see CAPABILITY-CONTRACT.md Part 2.

`allow_anonymous` (CLI: `--allow-anonymous`) is `rwtask run`'s own escape
hatch for local dev against public repos without a credentials.json: it
degrades every unresolved credential to anonymous instead of failing the
request. It exists only here -- `rwtask serve` never sets it -- because
degrading a REQUIRED credential must be a deliberate local-dev act, never
something reachable from a running pod. See Context.credential().
