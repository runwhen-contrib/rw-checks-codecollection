"""Exceptions the SDK raises. All of them are ordinary Python exceptions --
the task host (see host.py) catches anything a setup/task function raises and
turns it into a failed setup/task result entry; it never needs to special-case
these types.

class CredentialNotFoundError(KeyError):
    """Raised by Context.credential() when the named credential was not
    resolved for this request."""


class CapabilityLoadError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when a capability directory's manifest.yaml or tasks.py cannot
    be loaded."""


class UnknownTaskError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when a request names a setup/task that is not registered by the
    capability's tasks.py."""


class OutputTooLargeError(ValueError):
    """Raised when captured tool output exceeds the SDK's byte budget
    (sarif.py's SARIF_BYTE_BUDGET), before that output is fully read into
    memory or handed to a parser. Three call sites share this: Context.run()
    (context.py) bounds a subprocess's captured stdout while it is still
    streaming in, tools/_runner.py's run_to_file() stats a report FILE
    before reading it, and sarif.py's SarifClient.parse() (via its subclass
    SarifTooLargeError, see below) checks SARIF text already in hand before
    `json.loads`. All three exist for the same reason: whichever of these
    runs first is the one that would otherwise hold a pathological amount
    of text in memory before any downstream cap (MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT,
    ctx.findings.cap()) gets a chance to act.

    Context.run() is generic across every tool this SDK runs, SARIF-emitting
    or not -- so bounding it there also protects the plain `json.loads`
    calls in capabilities/rw-checks/adapters.py, which have no SARIF-shaped
    guard of their own: an oversized payload never makes it out of ctx.run
    in the first place.

    An ordinary exception, per this module's docstring: uncaught, it
    propagates to host.py's generic handler and becomes a failed
    TaskResult -- a disclosed failure, per FAILURE-POLICY.md, never a
    silent empty/partial findings list."""
