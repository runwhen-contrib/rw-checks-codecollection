"""`rwtask serve` -- long-polls the runner over plain HTTP/JSON (not Connect).

Relay HTTP contract (this is the wire the runner must implement to match):

    POST {relay}/v1/tasks/next
        body: {"poolId": "<poolId>"}
        -> 200 {"requestId", "request", "credentials": {name: value}, "scopeId", "deadlineMs"}
           (the "request" field is a Wire-3 RequestEnvelope; see models.py)
        -> 204 when idle (the server may hold the connection up to ~30s)

    POST {relay}/v1/tasks/{requestId}/result
        body: {"status": "ok"|"failed"|"timeout", "result": {...}, "error": "..."}
           ("result" is a Wire-3 ResultEnvelope, present only on status "ok")

Both relay calls carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, where <token> is read
fresh from the executor token file rather than cached at startup -- reading
is cheap and it lets a rotated or late-mounted token recover on its own
instead of wedging the pod. The two calls read it at different points,
though, not once per poll: GetTask reads it right before the poll, but
PutResult reads it AGAIN right before posting the result, because a
request can run for up to requestTimeoutSeconds (600s for rw-checks)
between those two points -- long enough for a token to rotate mid-request,
which would otherwise mean the POST silently used the stale one and lost
an already-computed result to a 401. If that second read is briefly
unreadable, PutResult falls back to the token GetTask used rather than
dropping the result (see _post_result). The token file path comes from
--token-file, else the EXECUTOR_TOKEN_FILE env var, else DEFAULT_TOKEN_FILE.
A missing/unreadable token file at GetTask time is logged and the loop
keeps polling -- it never falls back to an unauthenticated request.

`scopeId` must be a single path segment (see _is_safe_scope_id): the loop
creates and later deletes <workdir>/<scopeId>/, so anything else -- empty,
absolute, containing "/" or ".." -- is refused as a failed request before
the filesystem is touched.

Per request: create <workdir>/<scopeId>/, chdir there, run setup then each
task in request.tasks order (host.run_request), aggregate into the result
envelope, POST it. What happens to the scope dir next depends on the loaded
capability's `execution.mode` (EXECUTOR-CONTRACT.md "Execution modes"):

- `stateless` -- delete the scope dir. Unchanged from before.
- `stateful` -- keep it. A later request carrying the same scopeId finds its
  setup cached (host.py's setup-output cache) and its materialised tree
  still there, instead of re-cloning. Growth is bounded: this pod keeps at
  most `max_stateful_scopes` scopes warm, evicting the least-recently-used
  one (and wiping its directory) when a new scopeId would exceed the cap.
  A scope is never read by a request carrying a different scopeId -- each
  lives in its own <workdir>/<scopeId>/ directory.

Never raises out of the loop -- a poll or post failure is logged and
retried; a request that fails to execute becomes a "failed" PutResult, not
a crash.
