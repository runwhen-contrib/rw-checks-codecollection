"""The task host's core engine: run one RequestEnvelope's setup then tasks
against a capability's registered functions, in manifest/request order,
resolving `${setup.<name>}` references, and aggregate into a ResultEnvelope.

Shared by both `rwtask serve` (host.py:serve) and `rwtask run` (the local
reference implementation) -- same code path, per CAPABILITY-CONTRACT.md Part 2.

Never raises out of run_request(): a setup/task exception becomes a
failed setup/task entry in the result, and the rest of the request still
runs to completion.

Setup-output caching (EXECUTOR-CONTRACT.md "Addressing and caching"): the
pod is warm and sticky precisely so a materialised tree persists across
requests. A request's setup outputs are cached inside `scope_dir` --
keyed by the scope the caller already gave us, never a new identifier --
so a later request against the same scope (the mcp.v1 sync path: setup
present, no credentials) reuses them instead of re-running setup. The
cache lives on disk, not in this process's memory, so it survives across
separate `rwtask run`/`rwtask serve` invocations the same way the scope
itself does, and it dies when the scope does (eviction, a fresh pod).
See _load_setup_cache/_save_setup_cache below.
