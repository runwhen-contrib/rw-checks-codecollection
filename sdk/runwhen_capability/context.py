        ctx.log; the timeout (default DEFAULT_RUN_TIMEOUT) is enforced --
        a timeout raises subprocess.TimeoutExpired, which the task host
        treats like any other task exception.

        `env` is MERGED OVER the parent environment, never a replacement:
        a tool needs PATH and the rest of its runtime, and a caller that
        only wants to add one variable must not have to reconstruct
        everything else. Merged into a fresh dict per call rather than
        mutating `os.environ`, because tools run concurrently in one
        process -- a global mutation would leak into whatever else is
        running alongside.

        `inherit_env=False` replaces that merge with EXACTLY `env` -- no
        `os.environ` in the child at all. This is for a capability that
        runs tools whose OWN config, supplied by an untrusted repo, decides
        what that tool reads or reaches (rw-checks' guards.py): such a
        caller builds its own allow-list rather than handing the tool
        every variable the executor pod happens to hold, including
        anything secret. The default stays `True` -- capabilities/
        rw-worktree and every other existing caller relies on inheriting
        the parent environment, so opting OUT of that is a deliberate
        choice a caller makes, never the default.

        The case the MERGE exists for: the capability's root filesystem is
        READ-ONLY, so a tool that writes to the default `/tmp` fails
        outright. Only `workdir` (`/work`) is writable, so such a tool
        must be pointed at it -- see `tools/trivy.py`, whose vulnerability
        DB download died on `mkdir /tmp/trivy-...: read-only file system`.

        Bounded at SARIF_BYTE_BUDGET: a tool's stdout is captured
        INCREMENTALLY (Popen + a dedicated drain thread per stream, not
        subprocess.run's capture_output, which buffers everything before
        the caller sees any of it) so a pathological amount of output
        raises OutputTooLargeError -- the process is killed -- instead of
        being held in memory in full. This is the same failure this
        module's docstring already documents for SarifClient.parse(): the
        oversized-payload guard has to run BEFORE the bytes are fully
        materialised, not after, or the guard cannot prevent the OOM it
        exists to stop. Unlike parse() (which already has the whole SARIF
        text in hand and can check its length directly), ctx.run has to
        stop READING partway through, so it can only report a lower bound
        on the true size -- hence ">N bytes" rather than "N bytes" in the
        message. stderr gets the same treatment against a much smaller
        budget (_STDERR_BYTE_BUDGET) -- see that constant's comment.

        Both streams are drained by their own thread regardless of what the
        other is doing, specifically so the child can never block writing
        to a full pipe while this method is only reading the other one --
        the classic two-pipe deadlock. On a timeout OR an oversized-stdout
        kill, the process is killed and then waited on (never left a
        zombie) before either raising TimeoutExpired or returning control
        to the oversized-output check below.

        The kill reaches the whole process GROUP (`start_new_session=True`
        below, killed via _kill_process_group's `os.killpg`), not just the
        direct child `proc.kill()` would reach: a tool that shells out to
        its own scanner engine (semgrep, checkov, ...) can leave a
        grandchild running that inherits the same stdout/stderr pipes, and
        that alone is enough to keep a drain thread's `.read()` from ever
        seeing EOF -- turning a refusal that is supposed to be fast and
        1Gi-safe into a hung task instead (the lease then expires and the
        real cause is lost). The thread joins below are ALSO bounded
        (_DRAIN_JOIN_TIMEOUT), as a second, independent backstop: a
        grandchild that further detached into its own session escapes even
        the process-group kill, and this method still has to return control
        -- with the right exception -- rather than block on a thread that
        may now never finish.
