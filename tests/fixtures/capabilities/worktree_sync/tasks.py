"""Fixture capability: mimics rw-worktree's open(setup)+read(task) shape,
for exercising host.run_request's setup-output caching -- the mcp.v1 sync
read path is a request carrying `setup` but no credentials, against a
scope whose setup already materialised in an earlier (leased) request.

`open` requires a declared credential named "repo", exactly like
rw-worktree's real `open` (capabilities/rw-worktree/tasks.py) -- a request
with no credentials can only succeed here via a cache hit. It writes a
real file under the scope so `read` has real content to return, without
needing an actual git checkout.

`grep` routes through the real ctx.repo_fs.grep (repo_fs.py), like
rw-worktree's own `grep` task, so tests can exercise the real
TreeNotMaterializedError path and a real zero-match result -- not a
fixture-only stand-in. `wreck` is test-only: it deletes the materialised
tree from under a request, standing in for an eviction/reaped scope that
happens mid-request rather than waiting on the pod itself to be reaped."""
