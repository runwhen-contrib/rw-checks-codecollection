"""ctx.repo_fs -- read-only file/grep/ls access into an already-checked-out
tree, ported from internal/rwcheck/serve/{read,grep,ls}.go in runwhen-runner
(the v1 worktree host), including the glob-depth fix from that repo's
e0c9f16 ("globs match basenames at any depth; empty grep/ls results
marshal as []"). Backs the rw-worktree capability's `read`/`grep`/`ls`
tasks.

Every path input is confined to the tree via pathsafe.safe_path before it
touches disk -- ordinary input validation, not the sandbox mechanism (the
kernel-level sandbox is out of scope; see EXECUTOR-CONTRACT.md's "Open
decisions"). A path that escapes (absolute, "..", or an escaping symlink)
raises PathEscapesTreeError with a clear message. Entries *encountered*
while walking a tree for grep/ls (as opposed to a caller-supplied path) are
handled the same way v1 did: a symlink is skipped/not recursed into rather
than erroring -- it is tree content the walk found, not an input someone
is attempting to escape with.
