"""The rw-worktree capability's `query` task: a batch of grep/read/ls/
defs/refs ops against one checked-out tree, so a review agent answers
several questions in one round trip instead of one task request per read.

`run_query` is pure -- a tree path and the ops in, a QueryResult out -- and
built entirely on repo_fs's building blocks, so every path still goes
through pathsafe.safe_path and every cap repo_fs already enforces still
applies per op.

Failure is per op wherever the fault is the op's: a malformed op is
INVALID_OP, and a repo_fs input error (escape, not found, binary, bad
regex, ...) carries repo_fs.error_code's code. Neither fails the others.
Two things do fail the whole task: a malformed `ops` input itself, and
TreeNotMaterializedError -- an evicted tree is not an op's fault, and
host.py must see it to flag the envelope not_materialized, which is what
makes papi re-materialise and retry once.

Response budget: the whole output is held under QUERY_BUDGET, measured as
serialised JSON rather than content bytes, so per-op, per-match and
per-range structure and string escaping all count. Room for a
RESPONSE_BUDGET entry is reserved up front for every op, so the ops past
the cap can always still be answered with one. The op that straddles the
cap keeps the leading matches/entries/whole lines that fit (and says
`truncated`); every op after it is RESPONSE_BUDGET -- unless the very
first op is what didn't fit, in which case nothing earlier consumed any
of the budget, so that one op gets its own honest RESPONSE_BUDGET message
instead and later ops still run.

Time budget: QUERY_DEADLINE_SECONDS bounds the whole op loop the same way
QUERY_BUDGET bounds its bytes. Checked before each op starts; once it has
passed, that op and every op after it become DEADLINE instead of running,
and `truncated` is set -- the same exhausted-flag mechanism the byte
budget already uses, just a different reason and message.
