"""SARIF -> Finding, ported from internal/rwcheck/sarif (and the
resolveContext/SafePath helpers in internal/rwcheck/runner) in runwhen-runner.
Only understands the SARIF 2.1.0 shape rwcheck/this SDK needs
(runs[].results[]) -- not a general-purpose SARIF library.

Path normalisation mirrors the Go implementation exactly: an absolute
`file://` artifactLocation.uri (ruff among the tools that emit one) is only
trustworthy against the worktree root the operation actually ran in, so a
location that does not resolve under `root` is DROPPED (logged, not silently
passed through with an unnormalized path) -- such a path can never match the

# SARIF_BYTE_BUDGET: refuse a raw SARIF payload before json.loads ever builds
# a dict from it. MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT already caps the *parsed* result at
# 100,000 findings, but that cap runs too late to help here: `json.loads`
# builds one full copy of the report -- the dict, every nested list/dict, every
# string -- before any of our code (the islice in parse(), ctx.findings.cap())
# gets a chance to act, and that copy is what OOMs the pod on a pathological
# report. Measured: a 500k-finding / 132 MB runaway peaks at ~1.0-1.16 GB RSS
# even with the finding-count cap in place (see docs/static-checks/
# FAILURE-POLICY.md, "Memory, measured -- the findings ceiling does not
# protect the pod") -- over the 1Gi executor limit. This budget stops that
# copy from ever being made.
#
# Sized from PEAK RSS, not finding count -- an earlier version of this
# constant used ~371 bytes/finding (the WIRE size, i.e. papi's output result
# envelope) x MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT to get ~37 MB. That is the wrong
# quantity: this guard measures raw SARIF text per `parse()` call, i.e. per
# TOOL, and raw SARIF carries overhead the wire format strips out entirely
# (tool.driver.rules metadata, full locations/regions, snippets,
# fingerprints). Measured directly against the real case instead: `ruff
# check --output-format=sarif .` against the 468-platform monorepo (the same
# repo FAILURE-POLICY.md's 6.3 MB / ~18,700-finding WIRE figure comes from)
# produces 56.7 MB of raw SARIF / 48,064 findings -- ~1,180 raw bytes/finding,
# 3.2x the wire estimate. A 40 MB budget derived from the wire number would
# have REJECTED this real, legitimate scan.
#
# The actual constraint is peak RSS on a 1Gi pod, so the budget is chosen
# from measured RSS at each candidate size, using the WORST memory-per-byte
# shape (many tiny results, no location, minimal strings -- maximises
# dict/object count per input byte) alongside the real 468-platform ruff
# report and a synthetic "heavy tool" shape (5,000-rule tool.driver.rules
# block, snippets, full locations) for comparison. `parse()`'s own islice
# still caps how many Finding objects get built past MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT,
# so cost beyond that count is `json.loads` alone -- which is exactly what
# this budget bounds:
#
#   size    worst-case (tiny, no location) peak RSS
#   40 MiB  526 MB
#   64 MiB  749 MB   <- picked: right at the ~750 MB target, 324 MB under 1Gi
#   96 MiB  1045 MB  -- over target AND effectively at the 1Gi ceiling itself
#
# 64 MiB (67,108,864 bytes) is the largest of the three that stays at/under
# the ~750 MB target while leaving real headroom below the hard 1Gi OOM
# point: ~18% above the measured 56.7 MB real ruff/468-platform case (the
# only real single-tool raw SARIF size on record -- semgrep, trivy, gitleaks
# etc. were not installed locally to measure directly; if any of those
# routinely produce larger raw SARIF than ruff, e.g. via very large
# tool.driver.rules blocks, this budget should be re-measured against them).
# Coincidentally the same byte value as findings.py's 64 MiB papi-ingress
# figure (64 * 1,048,576) -- unrelated numbers that happen to match; this
# constant is derived from measured RSS above, not from the ingress limit.
#
# Secondary sanity check, not the basis for the number above: at the real
# 1,180 bytes/finding raw density measured on 468-platform, a report that
# actually carried a full MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT ceiling's worth of
# findings would be ~118 MB -- well past this 64 MiB budget. That is
# expected, not a conflict: the two caps guard different pathological
# shapes. This budget catches a single oversized report (however few or many
# findings it claims) before `json.loads` ever runs; MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT
# still bounds materialised Finding objects for a report that stays under
# this byte budget but claims more findings than exist ceiling-space for.
#
# A streaming parser (e.g. ijson) was considered instead -- it would let a
# large-but-legitimate report through where a flat byte budget cannot. Not
# worth it here: the real case has real (if narrower, ~18%) headroom under
# this budget, ijson is a new dependency baked into every capability image,
# and the failure mode this budget produces (a disclosed, honest refusal) is
# exactly what FAILURE-POLICY.md wants for a pathological report anyway. A
# byte guard is the simpler trade.

        touches the results past the +1st, rather than flattening all of
        them and discarding the excess only at the very end (cap() running
        last, after every copy in the pipeline had already paid for the
        full size -- see MAX_FINDINGS_PER_RESULT's docstring). Real results
        (measured: 6.3 MB / ~18,700 findings) stay far under the ceiling and

        `json.loads` ever touches it -- see that constant's docstring for the
        arithmetic and why a byte budget beats a streaming parser here. The
        check itself avoids `text.encode("utf-8")` on the common path: a
        Python str's UTF-8 encoding is always between `len(text)` (all-ASCII)
        and `4 * len(text)` (every character maximal-width) bytes, so
        `len(text)` alone already proves a report over budget (bytes can only
        be >= chars) without paying for an encode, and `4 * len(text)` at or
        under budget already proves a report under it (bytes can only be <=
        4x chars) -- encoding only has to run to get an exact byte count in
